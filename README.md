# wine-snob-ml

## Intro
  - This repo is designed to be an example project of another simple ML project. This project focuses on the 'training and tuning of a random forest for wine quality (as judged by wine experts) based on traits like acidity, residual sugar, and alcohol concentration.'
  - It focuses on basic python knowledge as well as the extensive Scikit-learn (or sklearn) for the machine learning side of the project.
